<p>YOU SUBMITTING THIS APPLICATION DOES NOT EQUAL A JOB CONTRACT. YOU WORKING FOR US IN ANY WAY DOES NOT EQUAL A JOB CONTRACT. IT DOES NOT MATTER IF THIS WORK WAS THE SAME AS WHAT YOU APPLIED FOR. IT DOES NOT MATTER IF IT WAS DIFFERENT. THINGS IN THE EMPLOYEE HANDBOOKS, PERSONNEL MANUALS, BENEFIT PLANS, POLICY STATEMENTS, AND ANY OTHER SIMILAR THINGS DO NOT CHANGE THIS. THE ONLY WAY TO CREATE AN ACTUAL JOB CONTRACT IS THROUGH SOMETHING SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT OR GENERAL MANAGER OF UNFINISHED BUSINESS. THIS IS ALSO THE ONLY WAY TO CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT THE EMPLOYMENT. THESE PEOPLE CAN FIRE YOU AT ANY TIME. YOU CAN LEAVE THIS JOB AT ANY TIME. THIS CAN BE DONE WITHOUT TELLING THE OTHER PERSON. YOU ALSO DON'T HAVE TO GIVE OR BE GIVEN A REASON. IF I GET THIS JOB, I KNOW THAT MY BENEFITS CAN CHANGE. THE JOB MAY CHANGE THEIR POLICIES AND  MY BENEFITS MAY BE LOWERED.</p>
